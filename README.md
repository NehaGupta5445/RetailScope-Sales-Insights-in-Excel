RetailScope – Sales Insights in Excel
RetailScope is an Excel-based business intelligence project designed to uncover actionable insights from a global retail dataset. The goal of this project was to build a clean, interactive, and insightful dashboard for business users using only Microsoft Excel, showcasing my ability to transform raw data into visual stories and decision-ready analytics.

🧠 Project Summary
This project uses simulated transactional data from a global superstore to explore how Excel can be used as a powerful tool for business analysis. Through advanced functions, pivot tools, and interactive dashboards, the project translates thousands of sales records into intuitive visualizations and KPIs that help answer key business questions:

Which regions are generating the most profit?

Which products or categories are underperforming?

How do discounts influence profit margins?

What are the monthly sales trends across categories?

🔍 Analysis Insights
Some of the key insights generated through the dashboard:

Certain regions consistently outperform others, especially when considering profit margins over raw sales.

High discounts don’t always drive higher sales — in many cases, discounting negatively impacted profit.

Some product categories dominate in volume, while others generate more profit per unit.

Seasonality trends are evident in sales data, with clear spikes during specific months.
